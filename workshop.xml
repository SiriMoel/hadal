[h1] Questions [/h1]
[b] How do I acquire wands? [/b]
Wands can be acquired from vanilla puzzles, chests and crafting.
To craft a wand you need a brace, handle and a core.
The core determines the tier of the wand. To craft a wand just throw the 3 parts together.
[b] Aren't Orbs difficult/annoying to find? [/b]
Yes. However, most of the orbs in Hadal are acquired from killing bosses which have been moved around the map.
[b] The Glomb? [/b]
The Glomb. The arena to fight it can be accessed via a portal in the lukki lair
