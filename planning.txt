LUSCA
funny shark boss, dashes around and has tentacles

should lusca be a worm-shark-thing or not?

tentacle purpose? possibly just verlet tentacles? possible attacks?
leaves a trail of projectiles (dont home at all, just sit there as "landmines")

NEW CHESTS


CRASHED SUBS (scattered around the map)
small ships around the map can be loaded with _pixel_scenes.xml
change wang tiles to have pixel, spawn sub and spawn thing inside sub from that?

LUSCA'S CURSE
chance to gain a curse level by doing specific things
depending on curse level you gain debuffs
curse is lifted by killing lusca
perk to reduce curse chance
