power plant somewhere (no, crashed ship on left wall)
OC somewhere BUT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED (needs more changing)

LUSCA
funny shark boss, dashes around and has tentacles

should lusca be a worm-shark-thing or not?

tentacle purpose? possibly just verlet tentacles? possible attacks?
leaves a trail of projectiles (dont home at all, just sit there as "landmines")

CRASHED SUBS (scattered around the map)
small ships around the map can be loaded with _pixel_scenes.xml
change wang tiles to have pixel, spawn sub and spawn thing inside sub from that?

LUSCA'S CURSE
chance to gain a curse level by doing specific things
depending on curse level you gain debuffs
curse is lifted by killing lusca
perk to reduce curse chance

OTHER
map room pixel scene (loaded through _pixel_scenes.xml) to guide the player
"tutorial" on "tablet" in spawn crashed sub

THE BASE (crashed ship replacement)
made by other "survivors" now turned into robotics by THE MACHINE (mecha kolmi remake)
turn chain gun into lore place with a place where survivors are turned into machines
new entrance mini biome thing
